# Git-Note

**Stash**

Stashing allows you to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed.

**Merge**

Merge a branch into the current branch.

**Rebase**

Rebasing in Git is a powerful way to integrate changes from one branch into another. It allows you to reapply commits on top of another base tip. This can lead to a cleaner project history, as it avoids the clutter that can come from merge commits.

**Cherry-Picking**

Cherry-picking allows you to apply a commit from one branch to another.
